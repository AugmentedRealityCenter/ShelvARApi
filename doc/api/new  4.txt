What I've done
- Crashed my server
- Created book_pings, book_tags, and call_numbers spots on swagger
- Created the first api declaration in book_tags which is for converting base64 to LC
- Gotten it so the resource URL is (I think) correct
- Read the article andrew found on mod rewrite

What I am going to do next (BY FRIDAY)
- Work to put ALL the docs on swagger 
- Fix my probably incorrect guess at what the resource URL is supposed to be
- Actually test that Mod-rewrite is working

What's stopping me
- My resource URL assumptions are probably wrong
- I don't understand some parts of swagger still
- Career fair is on Wednesday and hopefully interviews will be on Thursday and Friday
